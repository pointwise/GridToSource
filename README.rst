GridToSource
============
A Pointwise Glyph script which constructs a source point cloud using the grid point locations of selected domains or blocks.

Usage
~~~~~
This script can only be run interactively.

Optionally select any combination of domains or blocks (intialized or empty), or the script will prompt for selection. For each selected entity, a new source point cloud is created with the hard-coded spacing and decay factor at each location.
